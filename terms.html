  </ul>

  <h2>3) Third-party services</h2>
  <p>
    The automation relies on third-party services (TikTok APIs, Google services, hosting providers). Your use is also subject to

    To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages,
    or any loss of data, revenue, or reputation arising from the use of the automation or third-party services.
